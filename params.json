{"name":"Pioneer-rec","tagline":"Recovery program for Pioneer DVR-633H, DVR545H harddisks","body":"So there you are with your Pioneer DVR633H-S or DVR545H showing you an HDD Error and \r\nrefusing to boot...\r\nThis usually indicates that the harddrive in the recorder went bad.\r\nBut don't panic, there may be hope!\r\n\r\nUnlike other utilities for this task, this program is capable of reconstructing the movies from the harddrive by parsing the filesystem structure of the Pioneer DVR instead of just dumping MPEG-chunks!\r\n\r\nFor further information on how to use it and for technical details about the filesystem structure, please refer to the [README](https://github.com/leecher1337/pioneer-rec/blob/master/README.txt) file. \r\nFor the impatient ones, assuming you have a disk image image.dd and a recovery destination directory f:\\dump, just do:\r\n\r\n`pioneer_rec -d c:\\image.dd f:\\dump`\r\n\r\nBinary: [pioneer_rec.zip](http://dose.0wnz.at/scripts/cpp/pioneer_rec.zip)\r\n\r\nDiscussion: [Blog post](http://hardwarefetish.com/584-pioneer-dvr-recorder-harddisk-recovery)\r\n\r\nFor Panasonic DVR recorders, you can have a look at my [panasonic-rec](https://code.google.com/p/panasonic-rec/) project.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
